## Description
This repository contains a Jupiter notebook that I used to build models to determine which variables most affect the price of houses in King
County. I made use of different machine learning algorithms which include Lasso, Ridge, Quantile and ElasticNet. The findings and conclusions
are contained in the Jupiter notebook.
